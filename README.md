Batch export add-on for Blender 2.79

Note:
Development stopped due to the 2.8 release of Blender. No longer needed.

Purpose:
Adds useful export tools to Blender. Enables batch exports with various structures:
  - Grouped Meshes
  - Parent/Child Meshes
  - Individual Meshes
  
For example, it enables the export of all grouped objects into a single FBX file. For each group in Blender, it creates an FBX file with the assigned meshes.

This can be helpful when exporting several groups of meshes from the same scene.

Installation (Blender version 2.79):
- Download waffles.py from this repository.
- Launch Blender
- Select File -> Blender User Preferences
- Select "Add-ons" tab
- Select "Install Add-on from File" button
